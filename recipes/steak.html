    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>We've come up with what we think is the easiest steak recipe 
        we've ever seen. Follow along and you're soon to impress all your 
        friends with some mouth watering steak (and you'll barely have to 
        work for it!) Pair with your favorite sides, from fries and mac to
        our personal favorite, mashed potatoes and roasted green beans.</p>

    <h3>Step by Step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay your steak out on a cutting board and dry both sides as best as possible</li>
            <li>Season steak generously with salt and pepper and leave to come to room temp</li>
            <li>Put a skillet on the stove at high heat with a small coating of olive oil</li>
            <li>Once skillet is lightly smoking, add steak and don't move it for 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>Now you should be able to flip your steak and sear the other side for another 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Add 2 spoons of butter and some fresh rosemary and continually baste for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove steak from heat and let rest for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
