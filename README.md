# odin-recipes
In this project I will be creating a basic recipe website that I will build more upon later in the course
This project will work on some basic html skills and allow me to become more familiar with VSCode and WSL Ubuntu

Review: I learned a fair amount of HTML muscle memory with this assignment. I will need to work more to remember
commands off the top of my head.
